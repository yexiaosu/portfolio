        <div className="content">
          <p>
            Iâ€™m a first-year graduate student at UMSI, on the User-Centered Agile Development path. I majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering during my undergraduate learning process at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Also, I have some experience in web development and data analytics because of a related internship.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have many hobbies, including drawing, playing video games, making assembled models, etc. I am quite interested in drawing, though I have no professional training. For me, this hobby is my way of decompression and a manifestation of my love for life. If you are interested in my works, you can go to Gallery to see some of them.
